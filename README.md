Exploring The Monorepo (a practical, hands-on Typescript guide)

# "Can't we just..."
Note each folder in the `apps` and `libs` folders are individual projects,
to explore them in isolation consider cloning this repository:
```bash
$ git clone -b "attempt-1-can't-we-just" git@github.com:gaggle/exploring-the-monorepo.git
```

Then each project can be opened in isolation, 
e.g. to open `web` project in Visual Studio Code you can run this command:
```bash
$ code exploring-the-monorepo/apps/web
```
